        <p> Hi there! My name is Nick. I am currenly a student at the University of Michigan. I am a late comer to the CS program so I am playing a very intense game of catch up right now. I'm from a rural Michigan town where the computer education ended with a typing class in 7th grade so coming to college I never had CS on my radar but so far I am happy with the choice to switch. </p>
